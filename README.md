# The story you never wrote

This is an AI-powered collaborative storytelling application built with Next.js and Genkit.

"The story you never wrote" helps you overcome writer's block by co-creating a narrative with an AI partner. Provide a word and a mood, and the AI will craft the next sentence, allowing you to build a unique story, one sentence at a time.

## How it works

1.  **Set up**: Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google AI API key: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here`.
2.  **Start Writing**: The application begins a story for you.
3.  **Provide a Word**: You offer a single word to inspire the next part of the narrative.
4.  **Select a Mood**: Choose from 'Dreamy', 'Dark', or 'Motivational' to guide the tone.
5.  **Continue the Story**: The AI generates the next sentence, incorporating your word and matching the mood.
6.  **Export**: You can export your creation as a text file at any time.
